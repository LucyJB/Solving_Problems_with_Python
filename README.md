# Solving_Problems_with_Python
My notes for the Solving Problems with Python challenge provided by Code First Girls Programmes.

The scripts contain an obfuscated python script that need reverse engineering to solve:
1. What the program is designed to do
2. What process and methods are needed in order to reverse engineer the program.

There are 5 scripts plus a bonus one to solve.
